# Covid-19-Avoid-Area

**Overview**

> This application was developed to monitor the density of COVID-19 cases by county as well as to give the user resources for the pandemic. Along with an interactive map of active cases, we have supplied a COVID-19 testing location finder, recent top news articles related to the virus as well as a link to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) homepage. This application is meant to be your hub for information about the Coronavirus pandemic.

**Deployment**

> To deploy this application, launch the url in browser. The information displayed will update regularly to give the user an up-to-date analysis of the COVID-19 density by county. By clicking on the "Testing Centers" button in the navbar at the top of the page, the user can find testing centers in a state they are interested in. Accessed by clicking the "CDC Info" button, we have included some excerpts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention webpage regarding the virus, as well as a link to their webpage. Finally, by clicking the "Covid news" button, the user will be presented with five articles from the New York Times pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Technologies**

> This application was made using HTML, CSS, Pure (CSS framework), JavaScript and jQuery. Data was sourced from Bing COVID-19 Data, Postman COVID-19 Testing Locations and The New York Times Developer Network.

> **Future Development**

> For future iteration of this application, the developers could integrate Google analytics and use them to let the user know what the population density is of a certain business or type of business (e.g. restaurant, grocery store, coffee shop, etc)
