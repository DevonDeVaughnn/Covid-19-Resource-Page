    <h3><u><strong>What is COVID-19:</strong></u></h3>
    <h4> Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person. There
        are many types of human coronaviruses, including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract
        illnesses.
        <br>
        COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in
        humans.</h4>
    <h3><u><strong>Symptoms:</strong></u></h3>
    <h4>People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe
        illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have
        COVID-19:
        <ul>
            <li>Fever or chills</li>
            <li>Cough</li>
            <li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
            <li>Fatigue</li>
            <li>Muscle or body aches</li>
            <li>Headache</li>
            <li> New loss of taste or smell</li>
            <li>Sore throat</li>
            <li>Congestion or runny nose</li>
            <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
            <li>Diarrhea</li>
        </ul>
        This list does not include all possible symptoms. CDC will continue to update this list as we learn more
        about COVID-19.</h4>
    <h3><u><strong>When to get tested:</strong></u></h3>
    <h4>
        Considerations for who should get tested
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>People who have symptoms of COVID-19</li>
            <li>People who have had close contact (within 6 feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes) with
                someone with confirmed COVID-19</li>
            <li>People who have been asked or referred to get testing by their healthcare provider, or state ​health
                department</li>
        </ul>
        Not everyone needs to be tested. If you do get tested, you should self-quarantine/isolate at home pending
        test results and follow the advice of your health care provider or a public health professional.
        <br><br>
        You can visit your state or local hospitals website to look for the latest local information on testing.
        If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider first.
        <br><br>
        If you test positive, know what protective steps to take to prevent others from getting sick.
        <br><br>
        If you test negative, you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected. The test result
        only means that you did not have COVID-19 at the time of testing. Continue to take steps to protect
        yourself.
